We have already seen that linear programming is a method for calculating the best plan for achieving stated objectives in a situation in Which resource are limited. As such it is a method for solving the classic problem of economizing, Whether in the context of an entire economy, in that of a government program, or in a single firm. In this chapter We consider the application of linear programming to the problems of the *individual firm*[](preview end).

## *From vague to complex*

The problem of the optimal utilization of limited resources by the individual firm has long been studied in economics, particularly in the analysis of the theory of production in the short run. The received doctrine provides us With a convenient point of departure. Consider, then, a competitive firm Which cannot influence the prices of the factors that it uses or the products that it produces. 

The model usually employed for discussing the behavior of such a firm conceives of it as a unit of control Whose objective is a maximum time rate of profit and those variables of choice are the time rates of consumption of various inputs and of production of various outputs. The choices of production and consumption rates are interdependent; otherwise output Would be chosen very large (perhaps infinite) and input very small. The necessary interrelationships are expressed by means of a production function, and if We regard a production function as specifying all technologically feasible combinations of inputs and outputs, the problem of production amounts to selecting the most profitable point of the production function.

For most purposes of economic analysis We assume that this problem is solved. We do not care how it is solved in practice, although presumably it is usually not done by formulating the production function mathematically and finding its optimum by the methods of the differential calculus. More plausibly, the solution process is one of trial and error or survival of the fittest. But all this is neither here nor there. The important thing is that the problem is solved, by one means or another, and We can use the solution (Which, however arrived at, satisfies the conditions deduced from the differential calculus) to characterize the behavior of markets and their responses to changes in prices, techniques, tastes, or other conditions. 

The Conventional theory can be justified in terms like these, and often has been, because the analysis of the firm is but a step in the analysis of markets. But What if We are interested in the firm per se? What if We are interested in giving a prescription to the firm as to how to solve its optimizing problem? Then the method of finding the firm's optimum ceases to be irrelevant and We must look at the assumptions about the production function With a more critical eye. 

The production function is a description of the technological conditions of production, and the economist takes no direct responsibility for ascertaining it. Instead he regards it as falling Within the purview of the technologist or engineer. But there seems to have been a misunderstanding somewhere because the technologists do not take responsibility for production functions either. They regard the production function as an economist's concept, and, as a matter of history, nearly all the production functions that have actually been derived are the Work of economists rather than of engineers. The engineers do not, on these grounds, stand Convicted of neglect of duty. The fact is that engineers look at things somewhat differently from economists and the production function does not usually enter explicitly into an engineer's analysis. This is true for two reasons. First, the activities of firms, even small firms, are generally too complex to be considered as a Whole. The engineer can analyze an assembly line Without studying the shipping room or billing department, and therefore he has no occasion to formulate a production function for the firm as a Whole. Second, the variables of choice as they appear to the engineer are not the ones on Which economic analysis is based. His problem, typically, is not Whether to use slightly more capital and slightly less labor but how many units to install of a new machine that costs slightly more but requires less tending and has other distinguishing characteristics as Well.

Putting it roughly, the choice is not among various time rates of input and output but, more directly, among different Ways of doing things, each of Which implies its own characteristic pattern of input and output rates. The distinction We are drawing between the engineer's approach and the production-function approach does not bear directly on the facts of life or on empirical realism. We are stating merely that the production function short-circuits certain aspects of the problem that the engineer cannot afford to neglect. The economist cannot afford to neglect them either When he Wants to look inside the firm. Moreover, there is some advantage in talking the engineer's language. For, among other things, this is the language in Which engineering and accounting data are expressed. This is the point of View taken in linear programming.

Our point of view, then, will be that the essential choices made by a firm do not deal directly With levels of input and output, but rather concern the extent to Which "different Ways of doing things" are used. This concept of a "Way of
doing things" is by no means easy to define. The underlying idea is that a change in a Way of doing things implies a change in the composition of ingredients or results or both. Thus, to use the agricultural illustrations so prevalent in the theory of production, if a farmer sows his acre With a new variety of seed (thus decreasing the input of the old seed and increasing that of the new), or if he switches to a new crop entirely, or if he sows the old seed more thickly than last year-in any of these cases we should say that he is doing things differently. But if he should plant twice as many acres with the old seed using the old density of sowing, etc., then he is "doing the same things in the same way," except, as we shall say, at a higher level or intensity.,This attitude toward choices implies an assumption closely related to the assumption of constant returns to scale. We assume that if acreage is doubled While the treatment given each acre is unchanged, then output Will be doubled and so Will be all associated inputs. 

As an empirical matter, this might or might not hold true. In this agricultural example one feels that constant rates of return to an unchanged Way of doing things Will hold approximately but cannot hold exactly. Exact proportionality is impossible because, to suggest a few reasons, 

(1) yields toward the edge of a field are different from yields in the center and the proportion of edge to total changes With scale; 

(2) this edge problem also enters into the difficulties of cultivation; 

(3) the length of fencing is not proportional to acreage; 

(4) travel time to, from, and Within the plot is not proportional to acreage. These examples should illustrate the kind of nonproportional effects that are inevitable and also the possibility that the deviations from proportionality may be unimportant. In our formulation we shall assume that deviations from proportionality are unimportant and shall neglect them.,We can now define a Concept Which incorporates the idea of a "Way of doing things." This concept is that of a "process," or "activity," Which We define as a set of ratios obtaining among rates of consumption of Various inputs and rates of production of Various outputs. We conceive of a firm as making choices among a number of processes (each presumably corresponding to different physical operations, but that is not part of our definition). Each process, We assume, can be operated at any positive level so long as the necessary inputs are available. By changing the level of a process We mean, of course, changing the time rates of consumption of all its inputs and the rates of production of all its outputs in the same proportion. We repeat: The assumption that the level of a process can be varied is an assumption of fact Which is not likely to be exactly true. We assume also that a firm may use several processes simultaneously so long as necessary supplies are available. This assumption is,subject to the same empirical qualifications as the preceding one.

Still another assumption is that a firm has only a finite number of processes available to it. In cases in Which this assumption does not apply, the traditional marginal analysis of smooth curves is likely to be more appropriate than the methods of linear programming With Which We are concerned.  Agriculture, obviously, provides many examples in Which the number of processes available is, to all intents and purposes, infinite. On the other hand, there are many practical cases, even in agriculture, in Which the number of processes available is finite, sometimes very small.

If a firm employs several processes, then it follows from our definitions that the firm's total consumption of factors and total production of products Will be the sum of the quantities of factors consumed by the various processes and the
sum of the products produced by the individual processes, respectively. Thus a change in the proportions among the quantities of factors consumed and products produced by the firm can result only from a change in the levels at
Which the various activities are utilized. In this View of production the quantities of inputs and outputs of the firm cannot be altered directly, but only indirectly by means of changes in the levels of Various processes. Thus linear programming does not seek to determine directly the optimal quantity of each factor and product but, instead, the optimal level of each activity. From these levels, the factor and product quantities follow in due course.
